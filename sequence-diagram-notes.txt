/////////////////////////Overview of the Elements of a UML Sequence Diagram\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

A. sequence diagram: behavioral type diagram (see sequence-diagram image)
    1. common diagram that many senior-level developers like to use. The reason is, the more advanced as a developer you 
        get, the more you start to think of your application as a system that sends messages either internally or externally. 
        Being able to visualize what those messages look like is incredibly important.
    2. They speak to how the code needs to operate. If done well, it will make the implementation of the project much easier 
        to build.
    3. The elements that comprise a sequence diagram:
        a. Class Roles or Participants: (see sequence-diagram-images\class-roles-participants.png)
            * In example, user dashboard, commission settings, and commission validation engine.
        b. Activation or Execution Occurrence: (sequence-diagram-images\activation-execution-occurence.png)
            * represented by the 1 long grey rectangle and the two short white rectangles.
            * Essentially they are the event when something transpires when it either receives a message or when it sends it. 
              What that tells me from a developer's perspective, when I see that I know there's going to probably have to be some 
              type of method there's going to have to be a module or something that can manage that communication.
        c. Messages: (see sequence-diagram-images\messages.png)
            * The messages are represented by lines with arrows going in the direction that the message is being sent. They also 
              can have names. In this case each one of them have an associated response.
            * A message is not a method that you can use to send and recieve input.      
        d. Lifelines: (see sequence-diagram-images\lifelines.png)
            * Lifelines are those dotted lines that go from the participant all the way down for the entire diagram.
            * What they really represent is to make it easier for us to see each one of the stages and to give a spot where the 
              messages can be sent. They don't actually do anything, they're more there so we can know at what stage a message is 
              going to be sent to one of the participants and so on and so forth.
