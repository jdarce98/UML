////////////////////Overview of Class Diagram Elements\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

(see \structural-behavioral-images\class-diagram-breakdown.png)
1. The elements that make up a class diagram are:
    a. name
    b. attributes
    c. operations: always followed by (). 

2. Attributes have three different items at a minimum that you should include.
    a. Visibility: for example, public, private or protected
    b. name: for example, title, or slug
    c. Data Type: after title, we can see `string` for example.

//////////////////////UML Class Diagram Associations, Multiplicity, and Navigability\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

(see class-diagram-images\associations.png)
1. Jordan uses the term Associations and relationships interchangeably.

2. Associations are how classes relate to one another.
    a. In the example image, Jordan is showing us classes without the operations and attributes.
    c. Based on our example image, we can say: (see notes on Multiplicity below for explanation)  
        * guide belongs to a topic
        * topic has many guides
        * guide has many and belongs to tags
        * tag has many and belongs to guides  

3. Apparently there are three sub-points of associations. One of which is also called an association,
   which is confusing as fuck.
    a. Association
    b. Multiplicity: Multiplicity is how we designate the direction of the relationship in regards to numbers.
        * refers to the numbers above and below the associations between classes.
        * Topic can have 1 or more guides. The way that we can see this is, the line from topic to guide says 
          1...*, that means that a topic can have one or more guides.
        * Going in the opposite direction, guide has an association line to topic. A guide is always going to 
          have one topic. You see how we only have 1 by itself and there is no ...*, that means that a guide 
          belongs to a topic.
        * We have a guide and it can have 0 or more tags. That means, if you think about building a blogging 
          engine, you can create a guide. If you have a tag class attached to it, you may want to be able to 
          create this guide with no tags or create it with any number of tags.
    c. Navigability: shows how you can have one class communicate with any other class. This sets the rules 
       for knowing how that communication can take place.
        * You can find all of the guides for each topic because topic is connected to guide
          You can find all of the tags for a topic through a guide.
