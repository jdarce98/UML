A. Package diagrams: Used to see map out how we are organizing the entire code base. 
   Simply ways of wrapping some of the other components from other diagrams and what they represent.
   For example: If we have a class diagram and we want to:
   where you want to list out in detail each one of the attributes
   you want to list the different operations
   the connectivity between the two
   if they have multiplicity or not
   all kinds of things that are very low level.
