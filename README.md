UML notes from fullstack dev course bottega university

The notes.txt files contain notes on all of the videos contained within the listed section.
The title of each notes.txt file corresponds to the section name in devcamp.

There are 2 image folders. The title of each folder is the same as the title of its corresponding
notes.txt file. These folders contain images that supplement the notes.

Each notes.txt file is separated into sections by the devcamp video that the notes come from:
///////////////////////////Video\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
They appear in the same order that the devcamp videos apppear.
